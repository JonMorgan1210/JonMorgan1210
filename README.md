I am a student at the University of Maryland, College Park studying computer science. I plan on using my degree in order to become a full-stack software engineer/developer. All projects from planning and designing to testing and implementation have been developed from the ground up. For more information about my specific technical skills and experience, feel free to check out my [website](google.com).
